### Meta-data:
- Subject: **Exactness of SOS relaxations in copositive programming**,
- Advisors: [Roland Hildebrand](http://www-ljk.imag.fr/membres/Roland.Hildebrand/),
- Keywords: Copositivity, Parrilo, Sums-of-Squares,
- [Main Reference](http://www-ljk.imag.fr/membres/Roland.Hildebrand/emo/project_description.pdf)
- Where: [git repository on github.com](https://github.com/sofianetanji/copositive-matrices),
- Date: Fall 2020.

### [Quick description](http://www-ljk.imag.fr/membres/Roland.Hildebrand/emo/project_description.pdf):
> We present in this project an attempt at checking the exactness of the Parrilo relaxations on 5 families of special copositive matrices.
> In a first part, we implemented a semi-definite program which checks the exactness of the relaxations for random instances of the special matrices.
> After numerical confirmation of their exactness, we attempted to prove that every copositive 6 x 6 matrix is in a Parrilo cone.
